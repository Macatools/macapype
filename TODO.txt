Bug report
- Issue when using _spm docker versions (at least the latest rc7_spm and rc8_spm versions) with the -soft ANTS option

Road map to v0.3.2:
- replace in default params (used with -species, located in workflows) short_preparation_pipe -> preparation pipe, and modify params only if -params is not used

Bug report
Issues with padding, works only if short_preparation_pipe / crop_T1 (not with long preparation_prep / prep_T1 / crop in params.json)

29/06/2022 Added the following issues:

Road map to v0.3.2
- -template to provide user template.

19/05/2022: with params, if long_prep, do not work with ANTS_T1.
    also with -species, problem if crop_T1 and crop_T2 is available, -soft ANTS_T1 will crash

17/05/2022 Added the following issues

Road map to v0.3.2
- make use of macapype_CI.zip in the examples + build the doc at all the release
- reframe automated definition of short_preparation_pipe based on the content indiv_params.json
- add more command line options (in the default, but interfering with the params):
    -no_crop if data are already cropped (see previous point)
    -export_5tt for exporting 5tt
- 5tt with 6 priors -> gm cortical and subcortical as 2 first tissus


Road map to v0.4
- better reorientation tools
- better bet-cropping


16/05/2022 Release v0.3.1
