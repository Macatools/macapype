Neuropycon
**********

Neuropycon is an open-source multi-modal brain data analysis kit which provides **Python-based
pipelines** for advanced multi-thread processing of fMRI, MEG and EEG data, with a focus on connectivity
and graph analyses. Neuropycon is based on `Nipype <http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_,
a tool developed in fMRI field, which facilitates data analyses by wrapping many commonly-used neuro-imaging software into a common
python framework.

Neuropycon project includes two different packages:

* |ephypype| based on |MNE python| includes pipelines for electrophysiology analysis


Neuropycon provides a very common and fast framework to develop workflows for advanced analyses, in particular
defines a set of different **pipelines** that can be used stand-alone or as **lego** of a bigger workflow:
the input of a pipeline will be the output of another pipeline.

For each possible workflow the **input data** can be specified in three different ways:

* raw MEG data in **.fif** and **.ds** format
* time series of connectivity matrices in **.mat** (Matlab) or **.npy** (Numpy) format
* connectivity matrices in **.mat** (Matlab) or **.npy** (Numpy) format

   Main inputs and subsequent pipeline steps

Each pipeline based on nipype engine is defined by **nodes** connected together,
where each node maybe wrapping of existing software (as MNE-python modules or radatools functions)
as well as providing easy ways to implement function defined by the user.
